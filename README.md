# Arctic_Modeling
Arctic Ice Modeling Report
This repository contains the code and .aprx file to visualize changes in Arctic sea ice around the north pole through arcgis pro by utilizing remote sensed imagery and map algebra. Through web scraping and API authentication, daily carbon concentrations and temperature changes from NOAA weather stations were collected. Using jupyter lab, changes in atmospheric composition from the CO2 data can show how temperature and specifically ice latitude could potentially change.

The pdf file contains a report about the processes and some final maps. The climate_model.ipynb file contains the code that models the climate with inputs derived from atmospheric composition. The data_collection_cleaning.ipynb file contains the code for web scraping and API calling (collects the climate data).
